# If I Had More Time

Sadly all good things comes to an end. But these are some ideas I would've liked to add to the app.

- Improve the styling of the app, especially the look and the layout of the buttons.
- Make the app more responsive to a wider selection of mobile devices.
- I would add a tooltip for each image when hovering. Providing more information.
